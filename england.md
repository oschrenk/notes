# England #

## Durham ##

[Durham University](http://www.dur.ac.uk/) Beautiful Campus. The uni itself was closed, but the library was open, showing first edition folios of Shakespeare, Newton's Mathematica. Oh yeah...

There is a small second hand shop at the end of North Road, just before the bridge (Silver Street), left, down. I bought an awesome sweater there!

Forget the Durham Indoor Market. All rubbish.

[Durham Cathedral](http://www.durhamcathedral.co.uk/) Fork the money over and walk up the stairs. Awesome view. The courtyard and the cathedral itself (with an added tower) are used in the Harry Potter movies.

## Whitby ##

There is a bus from Durham to Whitby (but only from April to September). It takes a few hours by Bus. It isn't really faster by train. If you have a car take it. 

There is a beach. Dip your toe in the water.

[Whitby Abbey](http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/properties/whitby-abbey/) First up the 199 stairs. The Abbey itself is a ruin. YOu have to pay to visit it. Must see. It was closed, but there was opening, where you can sneak in. Being alone there was breathtaking. It is beautiful. 

[St. Mary's Church](http://www.sacred-destinations.com/england/whitby-st-mary-church.htm) It looks like nothing from outside. But inside is beautiful. Make sure to visit the graveyard with its wonderful view.

## York ##

Such a lovely town to just walk around, go shopping. Get some butter fudge. 

[York Minster](http://www.yorkminster.org/) Beautiful. 

[York City Wall](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/York_city_walls) You can walk on top of the York city walls.
