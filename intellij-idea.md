# IntelliJ IDEA #

While I thought that Eclipse has some weird default settings, IntelliJ really takes the cake. The out-of-box experience is so bad that I disregarded the IDE for several years, trying it every other year. Which is a shame, as it is quite a good piece of software but the defaults especially the keyboard shortcuts are just awful.

- Disallow placement of caret after end of line. `IDE Settings > Editor > Virtual Space > Allow placement of caret after end of line`
- Show line numbers. `IDE Settings > Editor > Appearance > Show line numbers`
- Show method separators. `IDE Settings > Editor > Appearance > Show method separators`
- Show tabs in single row. `Editor > Editor Tabs > Show tabs in single row`
