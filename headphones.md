# Headphones #

Closed

- isolate ears from outside world
- cover entire ear
- prevents sound from leaking in, but also from leaking out
- certain frequencies can resonate more than others, resulting in poor sound quality

Open

- do not covert entire ear
- allows background noise to seep in
- this air flow reduces resonance
