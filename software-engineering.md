## Branching Strategies & Versioning Control ##

[Branching strategy is not a remedy for instability](http://altdevblogaday.com/2012/02/09/branching-strategy-is-not-a-remedy-for-instability/)

> Branching strategy changes are in response to the instability that follows fast growth.
> Branching is not designed to fix code instability. Branching is a way to isolate changes and manage a release.

Branching isn't a solution, you need a cultural shift towards testing and better infrastructure. These shift takes time and effort.
