## Stackexchange ##

I like to use [stackexchange](http://stackexchange.com/) to keep me informed about different processes.

While you can add favorite tags for each site, you can only subscribe to the rss feed of all your favorite tags. But I like to keep the rss feeds separate from each other.

You can copy your favorite tags and build your own rss feed by joining them with `+or+`, and prefix it with `http://<site>.stackexchange.com/feeds/tag`. For example I'm interested in graph theory so I favorited `graph-theory`, `graph-isomorphism`, and  `graph-algorithms`. The subscription feed woul look like this:

	http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/feeds/tag/graph-theory+or+graph-isomorphism+or+graph-algorithms
