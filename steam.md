## Using Offline Mode on a Mac ##

1. Start Steam online - make sure the Remember my password box on the login window is checked
2. Verify that all game files are completely updated - you can see the update status for a game under the Library section (when the game shows as 100% - Ready it is ready to be played in Offline Mode)
3. Launch the game you would like to play offline to verify that there are no further updates to download - shut down the game and return to Steam once you have confirmed that the game can be played
4. Go to Steam > Preferences to ensure the Don't save account credentials on this computer option is not selected
5. From the main Steam window, go to the Account menu and select Go Offline
6. Click Restart in Offline Mode to continue.
