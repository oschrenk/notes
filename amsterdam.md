## Transportation ##

 The OV-chip card (OV-chipkaart) smart card system is in use for public transport in the Netherlands. This means you need to check-in and check-out when boarding and alighting using the card readers. This applies to trams, the metro and buses in Amsterdam.

 There a various types of tickets available:

1. **Single-Journey**. A "disposable" OV-chip card and is valid for 1 hour's travel on GVB public transport including any transfers. It costs €2.80 (2013 price).
2. **"Anonymous" OV-chip card**. Cards costs €7.50. You can load credits onto the "e-purse" of the card . On checking in and out, the correct fare is deducted from your card's balance based on the distance travelled. In Amsterdam this is currently €0.86 for boarding plus €0.145 per km. This is cheaper than using the above single, especially for shorter journeys.
3. **"Personal" OV-chip card**. For residents who wish to register their details and link the card to a bank account. This card allows to use subscription models to be loaded onto the card. For example a monthly GVB season ticket (€88) or an annual GVB season ticket (€880).
4. **GVB Night Bus Ticket**. A single ride on a night bus costs €4.50. It is also possible to load 12 night bus rides on an OV-chip card for €34.
5. **Unlimited GVB Travel Tickets**. Valid for a set period of time and allow you to travel on the GVB network in Amsterdam. The 24 hour disposable ticket can be bought on board trams and buses. The others are available at GVB Tickets & Info office outside Amsterdam central station.

## Bicycle ##

Get a bicycle as quick as you can.

Waterlooplein is a good place to try. Marktplaats or the bulletin boards at the supermarkets are also a good bet.

## Utilities and Services ##

### Energy: Electricity & Gas ###

The energy sector in Netherlands is liberalized and there are a number of companies which you can choose from - the company you select will provide you with both electricity and gas.

Netherlands has some of the highest retail electricity prices in the world. Monthly energy bills will be in the region of €100 to €200, depending on your usage. Meter readings are done on an annual basis.

Netherlands is on 230v mains voltage with 2 pin plugs. Power cuts are extremely rare.

### Water ###

The [quality](https://www.waternet.nl/over-waternet/zaken-doen-met-waternet/gegevens-drinkwaterkwaliteit/) (2012 4th quarter averaged 8.1 °dH)of the drinking water in Netherlands is very good.

The cost of consumption is dependent on the number of official residents in a home - roughly around €42 per person per year. If there is a water meter you will pay per cubic metre consumed.

On top of this you have to pay sewerage and maintenance fees to both Waternet and via city taxes. If you are in rental accommodation you may not have to pay for water, but check with your landlord or agent.

## Healthcare ##

If you are coming to live in the country then it is obligatory to have a basic Dutch health insurance (basisverzekering) policy. The cost of basic Dutch medical insurance is around €110 per month for everyone regardless of age and state of health. As of 2012, there is also a compulsory excess (eigen risico) where you pay the first €220 of certain medical costs. You can also lower your monthly premium by €10-20 by choosing a higher excess.

The basic insurance policy will cover visits to doctors and specialists, medical treatment, hospital care and prescriptions. Dental coverage is only included for those under 22 - so you need to pay extra if dental cover is required.

When you have found somewhere to live you should register with a local general practitioner - either close to your home or place of work. Making an appointment is relatively straight forward and many practices also have a telephone consultation hour (spreekuur) set aside to deal with patient queries. If you require a specialist you will need a referral from your GP.

## Housing ##

Opinions on neighborhoods from various reddit users

> There is really no reason to live in the center, there are many nice places outside that are still within Amsterdam and where you'll still be able to cycle to centre. I would say **Osdorp is a good option.**
**IJburg is also fine, but may be a bit far for cycling** unless you're going somewhere in the east.
Amstelveen may also be a good option. In all these cases, public transport would be mostly tram/metro and those are excellent.
The one place **not to go would be South-East (Zuid-Oost)**, which is considered unsafe (though I do know people living there who deny this; also unsafe here is nothing compared to unsafe in for example the US). I'm not too fond of North (Noord) either, but I think opinions are divided here.

---

> If these places are not affordable either or you can't find something suitable (the private rent market is quite small, especially for the lower price range) you could go to **Diemen (metro+train connections), Hoofddorp (bus+train connections), Hilversum or Almere (train)**. All of them are very well-connected to Amsterdam. In Almere you can get very nice housing at low prices, it also a substantial city center and it is very safe for a child to grow up (no through traffic in residential neighbourhoods), although the city is considered to be pretty boring.

---

> I would suggest **looking into Noord, Osdorp, Slotervaart, Bijlmer (in that order)**. They are suburbs, maximum 30-40 min away from the city centre and your best bet for affordable housing.
