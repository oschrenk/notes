Notes taken from Zach Holman's Talk [Scaling Github](http://zachholman.com/talk/scaling-github/):

- Scaling is People + Technology
- Happy employees are productive employees
- Don't have _the person_ who knows everything, it's a synchronous bottleneck
- every talk is recorded and viewable
- automate
- ship early, ship often
- metrics, use only important ones
- allow, encorage side projects and small hacks, they can grow into business value, make developers happy, and is learning
