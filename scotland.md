## Places ##

### Stirling ###

- [Stirling Castle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling_Castle) I don't know exactly why. But I loved it. The view across Stirling. [Wallace Monument](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallace_Monument) barely visible because of the fog. The history, the battles, ... 
- There is a lovely cafe in town, I think it's on Friars Street. It looks like nothing special from the outside. Once inside you have to go the the first floor, where the have a large room, full of used stuff of all sorts.

### Loch Lomond ###

[SHYA](http://www.syha.org.uk/), [Loch Lomond](http://www.syha.org.uk/hostels/central/loch_lomond.aspx) Impressive looking house, equally impressive view of the lake. Was closed when I was there :(. 

### Glen Coe ###

[Glen Coe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glen_Coe) So beautiful I could cry.

### Fort William ###

The city itself offers nothing much. I guess it's a nice base for visiting [Ben Nevis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Nevis)

Let it be known here that I despice the guys at the Ben Nevis Destillery. They wouldn't offer us a tour just because we were only two persons. They really must love their product.

### Eilean Donan Castle ###

- [Eilean Donan Castle](http://www.eileandonancastle.com/) It's awesome. Go there early in the morning clib arround and have a picnic at the sea.
