# Python #

	$ brew install python

	A "distutils.cfg" has been written to:
	  /usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.3/lib/python2.7/distutils
	specifing the install-scripts folder as:
	  /usr/local/share/python

	If you install Python packages via "python setup.py install", easy_install, pip,
	any provided scripts will go into the install-scripts folder above, so you may
	want to add it to your PATH.

	Distribute has been installed, so easy_install is available.
	To update distribute itself outside of Homebrew:
	    /usr/local/share/python/easy_install pip
	    /usr/local/share/python/pip install --upgrade distribute
