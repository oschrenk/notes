## Eulers Identity ##

<< e^(i pi) + 1 = 0 [Euler's identity]>>

- pi is the ratio of circle diameters to its curcumference
- The height of an elephant (from foot to shoulder) = 2 x pi x the diameter of its foot.
- degrees are an arbitrary number, even aliens would use radians
- <<180Â° = pi>>
- <<360  = 2pi>>
- <<e^x>> is its own differential
- <<e^x = x^0/!0 + x^1/!1 + x^2/!2 + x^3/!3 + x^4/!4 + ...>>
- <<e = 2.7 1828 1828 45 90 45 ...>>
- <<sin x = x^1/!1 - x^3/!3 + x^5/!5 - x^7/!7 +  ... >>
- <<cos x = x^0/!0 - x^2/!2 + x^4/!4 - x^6/!6 +  ... >>
- <<i^2 = -1>>
- Complex numbers add another dimension and can therefore be written as distance to 0 point <<4 +3i = 5(cos theata + i sin theta) >>
- therefore <<e^(i pi) >> is <<-1>>
