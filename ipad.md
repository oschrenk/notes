## Dimensions ## ##



On [developer.apple.com/ipod/cases.html](http://developer.apple.com/ipod/cases.html) Apple has released dimensional drawings of all mobile devices.



Screen Size:



width

:	149 mm

length

:	198.1 mm



1024x768 px



That means



1 mm

:	5.154 px ≈ 5 px

1 cm

:	62.8436764 px ≈ 50 px

1 px

:	0.19345 mm ≈ 0,19 mm

10 px

:	1,9345 mm ≈ 1,9 mm

100 px

:	19,345 mm ≈ 19 mm



## Usability ##

### Mental Model ###



In the field of Human–Computer Interaction (HCI)7, the term _mental models_ refers to "many different aspects of users’ knowledge about the systems they use" [Payne08][#Payne:2008]. 



Mental models are powerful for immersive apps, which often heavily rely on (beautiful) graphics. IPad's strength is its amazing display and offers such possibilities.



#### Magazine Mental Model ####



Applications for magazines blend the mental model of a paper magazine with the mental mode of a computer. Eg.

- swiping for turning pages

- access to hyperlinks



Good

- page indicators let user know that they can/must swipe



Bad

- page numbers are a poor navigation mechanism

- scroll or swipe to get to next page

- mix scrollable and swipe-able content in multiple panels

- inconsistent swipes - show part of bigger picture or next page article.

- no information scent ("next article" - which article?)



Conclusion

- page-by-page model is unnecessary, does not make use of habits for the web

- sequential model for navigating doesn't work



## Touch Screen ##



- Implement two gestures for turning pages: Tapping Side of the screen and Swiping

- clear action oriented tappable areas 

- plan for accidental taps (how do I get back?)

- A target area must look as if it can be tapped.

- The context of a target influences the affordance of that target. (Text by itself may seem more tappable than text surrounded by widgets.)



## Lack of Affordances: Where Can I Tap?



- don't hide controls

- hyperlink content

- provide search

- bottom tab bar is often ignored - focus near top



## Multiple Panels ##



- good for pulling information into single view

- don't disconnect action/feedback
