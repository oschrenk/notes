## Mac would always eject discs ###

Try resettings SMC

What helped me (for a few dvds) was to flip the Macbook 90° (no joke) and trying to load the disc. This is a strong indicator for having hardware issues.

## How to reset SMC ##

Try each of the following steps in this order before you reset the SMC.  Test the issue after completing each troubleshooting step to determine if the issue still occurs.

 - Press `Command + Option + Escape` to force quit any application that is not responding.
 - Put your Mac to sleep by choosing the Apple () menu from the upper-left menu bar and then choosing Sleep. Wake the computer after it has gone to sleep.
 - Restart your Mac by by choosing the Apple () menu from the upper-left menu bar and then choosing Restart.
 - Shut down your Mac by by choosing the Apple () menu from the upper-left menu bar and then choosing Shut Down.

## Audio doesn't work ##

At some point audio output didn't work. I couldn't even change volume. What happened was that somehow my Macbook was outputting digital audio (indicated by a red light from the headphone jack). Inserting a headphone plug a few times and wiggling it around helped reset things.
