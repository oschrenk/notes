Language building blocks

- `expression` expression are the part of the program that evaluate to a value. Expression have types but values do not.
- `block expression`
- `types` expression have types that express some restrictions on programs
- `values` exist in the computer memory and are what programs manipulate
- `declaration` does not evaluate to a value, but instead gives it a name
- `definitions`
- `statements`
- `literal expression` represents a fixed value in the program text that stands for itself. Not to be confused with the value itself, which is the representation in memory after the program has run.
- `literal` shorthand for _literal expression_
- `keyword`
- `syntax`
- `evaluation` `1 + 2 + 3` and `6` have the same result type and return value but arrive at the result in different ways. Neither expression has side effects, and are interchangeable from a user's point of view. This is known as the _substitution model of evaluation_
- `blocks` special kind of expression. They allow us to sequence computations.

Language features

- `object`
- `class` Are templates for creating objects
- `constructor`
- `field`
- `methods`
- `generics`
- `function`
- `operator`
- `parameters`
- `arguments`
- `conditionals` special kind of expression. They allow to choose an ex expression to evaluate based on some condition. The expression that is not selected is not evaluated.

Type systems

- `invariance`
- `covariance`
- `contravariance`

Language paradigms

- `polymorphism` see _polymorhpic dispatch_
- `polymorhpic dispatch` A fundamental object-oriented approach. TODO
- `pass by reference`
- `pass by value`

Programming style

- `functional programming`
- `pattern matching`
- `product type` Describes a _has-a and_ relationship of data
- `sum type` Describes a _is-a or_ relationship of data
- `algebraic data type` A _product type_ or _sum type_
- `structural recursion` Is the process of breaking down data into smaller pieces

- `functor`
- `monad`

Math

- `associative`
- `commutative`
- `distributive`
- `monoid`
- `semigroup`
- `ring`
