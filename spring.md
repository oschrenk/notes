# Spring Framework



- Framework to address complexity of JavaEE development

- Offers multiple modules/components



## Core Container



- Dependency Injection Framework.

	- Type1: Interface Injection

	- Type2: Setter Injection

	- Type3: Constructor Injection



Dependency Injection is a form IoC (Inversion of COntrol) that removes explicit dependence on container API. Java methods are used to inject dependencies

- application code is easier to test. Beans have simple, core Java properties and method which are easy to test.

- explicit dependencies. All objects needed for execution of a method are known without reading the code.

	

`BeanFactory` to create objects, two modes

- Singleton. There is one shared instance of the object, which will be retrieved on lookup. It is often used for stateless service objects.

- Prototype. Each retrieval will result in creation of an independent object.



The `org.springframeworek.beans.factory.BeanFactory` is a simple interface. The most common use `BeanFactory` implementation is probably	

	

		BeanFactory factory = new XMLBeanFactory(new FileInputSteam("mybean.xml"));



All beans defined in XML are lazily loaded that means that they will only be instantiated when they are needed.



Each bean definition can be a POJO or a `FactoryBean`
