# Guild Wars 2 #

[Guild Wars 2](https://www.guildwars2.com), a free to play MMO set in a fantasy world. It offers a single player game within the same world, instantiating levels if one chooses to enter and participate in single player events.

It offers very complex game mechanis, that are very hard to understand for genre novices.
