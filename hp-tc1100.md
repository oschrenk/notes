The Service guide says you need:

- Philips PM2.0x4.0
- Torx TM2.5 x 8.0 (I'm in Germany and I bought a T8x40)

## Garbled Screen/Video Output ##

There is a defect in the solder job on the video chip attached to the system board.

**Solution**: You will need to replace the system board and the keyboard receiving bracket inside the computer to fix this problem.

Note: The system board's connections near the graphics controller can be severed (its a multilayered board so you might not be able to see it if you looked) when the keyboard can move inside the keyboard bracket thus causing your garbled / checkerboard screen.

For this reason, you can sometimes temporarily get it to boot correctly by tilting the screen towards you all the way before turning it on. We've also seen some cases where disconnecting the keyboard and trying to boot will work. You can use those ideas only as temporary fixes though, and I'm sorry to say that this problem will get progressively worse until you repair it.

**Workarround**: It turns out that it isn't because of the keyboard bracket causing hairline fractures on pcb but the bga connections of the graphics card.

A simple session of solder reflow for the main board is all that is required. With reflow work the main thing you have to be careful of is bumping the components when the solder is still liquid.

1. remove the main board from the computer
2. remove anything on the main board that is not nailed down. (heat sinks, the pcmcia bracket, ALL THE TAPE on the board)
3. Reflow in a toaster oven. There are a few good guides on the net but the main point it bring it up to temperature and let it cool down slowly.
4. Reassemble and enjoy.

**Easy fix**

Apply Pressure on the video chip by placing a folded piece of paper or even better something made of metal to conduct heat on the chip. I recomend placing a 1" metal washer on top of the video chip. So that it does not move around, be sure to wedge one end of it under the black tape that covers half the video chip. Now re-attach the heatsink cover and bingo, problem solved AND your video chip is keeping cool.
