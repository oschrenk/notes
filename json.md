### Java ###

[Json Java parsers / generators microbenchmark](http://blog.novoj.net/2012/02/05/json-java-parsers-generators-microbenchmark/)

The biggest three are

- [FlexJSON](http://flexjson.sourceforge.net/)
- [GSON](http://code.google.com/p/google-gson/) 
- [Jackson](http://jackson.codehaus.org/)

I only have first hands experience with GSON. I like the API to read and build JSON. 

After looking at the Jackson documentation though it seems thaz their API is pretty much the same. As it offers more flexibility (option for parsing comments and json keys without quotes) and the small speed advantage I think I will switch to Jackson in my projects.
