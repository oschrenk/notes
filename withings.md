### Problems

You might get a scecurity warning from macOS that "PairingWizard.app" canâ€™t be opened because it is from an unidentified developer.". To fix that open "System Preferences" -> "Security". Thre should be a message "PairingWizard.app" was blocked from opening because it is not from identified developer. Withings should sign this application, but my guess is that they stopped development. Click on "Open anyway", a dialog pops up, asking if you are sure, confirm and thhen re-open the "PairingWizard.app". It should open.
