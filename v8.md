## Cross compile for ARM ##

Download and install the NDK for your platform (`darwin` in this instance)

	wget http://dl.google.com/android/ndk/android-ndk-r8d-darwin-x86.tar.bz2
	tar xjf android-ndk-r8d-darwin-x86.tar.bz2
	rm android-ndk-r8d-darwin-x86.tar.bz2
	export ANDROID_NDK_ROOT=$(find $(pwd) -name "android-ndk-r8d" )

Prepare v8

	git clone git://github.com/v8/v8.git
	cd v8
	make dependencies

Build shared library for ARM

	make -j8 GYPFLAGS="-Dcomponent=shared_library" android_arm.release

You can find the library in `out/android_arm.release/lib.target/`

## Trobleshooting ##

### error: 'class v8::Object' has no member named 'GetPointerFromInternalField' ###

I was building a project that was using [libv8-juice-20101126](https://v8-juice.googlecode.com/files/libv8-juice-20101126.tar.bz2), a rather old version of v8-juice. I got

	/usr/local/include/v8/juice/ClassWrap.h: In static member function 'static void* v8::juice::cw::Extract_Base<T>::ExtractVoid(const v8::Handle<v8::Object>&, bool)':
	/usr/local/include/v8/juice/ClassWrap.h:542: error: 'class v8::Object' has no member named 'GetPointerFromInternalField'
	In file included from ../scriptInterpreter/HpcWrapper.hpp:31,
	                 from ../scriptInterpreter/HpcWrapperCallbacks.hpp:30,
	                 from ../scriptInterpreter/ScriptInterpreter.hpp:36,
	                 from ScriptHandling.cpp:16:
	/usr/local/include/v8/juice/ClassWrap.h: In static member function 'static v8::Persistent<v8::Object> v8::juice::cw::ClassWrap<T>::wrap_native(v8::Handle<v8::Object>, typename v8::juice::convert::TypeInfo<T>::NativeHandle)':
	/usr/local/include/v8-juice/juice/ClassWrap.h:1223: error: 'class v8::Object' has no member named 'SetPointerInInternalField'

This is because `Object::GetPointerFromInternalField` and `Object::SetPointerInInternalField` have been deprecated in [r12849](https://code.google.com/p/v8/source/detail?r=12849) and removed in [r13372](https://code.google.com/p/v8/source/detail?r=13372).

Switching back to v8 3.15 should work

	git clone git://github.com/v8/v8.git
	cd v8
	make dependencies
	git checkout -b 3.15 origin/3.15
