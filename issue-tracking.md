## Requirements ##

### Must-Haves ###

- Cross-Referencing of Tickets via `#<ticket-id>`

### Optional ###

- Commit Referencing via `<hash>` or `r<revision>` or equivalent

## Annoyances ##

### Mantis ###

- No `.` allowed in usernames. Very annoying as almost every enterprise follows `forename.surname@domain.tld` naming scheme
- Watchers are added through their own field. I like `@mention` in a comment field much better to pull other users in, or to add a star to add me as an interested user.
- Adding files are old school client-server model. We have HTML5 people. Drag and Drop exists!
- the actions of what to do with an issue is below added files. You always have to scroll to it. Why not at the top, or at the bottom?
- Notification E-Mails are quite useless as they only paste text content of the complete issue instead of the changes to the issue.
