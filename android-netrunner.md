# Android Netrunner #

Android Netrunner is a two player Living Card Game (LCG) set in a dystopian cyberpunk future where monolithic corporations control the vast majority of human interests. The corporation works to advance its agendas, while a subversive hacker, known as a runner, attempts to access and steal those agendas. To win the game each player needs to score seven points from advanced or stolen agendas, but from there the corporation and runner's methods diverge. Corporations seek to score agendas by advancing them, which costs both **clicks** and **credits**. To buy the time and credit they need they must secure their servers with powerful security programs called **ICE**. ICE comes in different varieties, from simple **barriers** to aggressive **sentries**. Runners need to spend their clicks and credits to acquire the tools of the hacker trade, installing the necessary hardware and ICE breaker programs to run past the corporation's security measures. Filled with calculated laughs and high stacks hacks, Android Netrunner allows you to change your reality one run at a time. Welcome to the future, welcome to Android Netrunner.

## Corporations & Runners ##

Before starting a game the corporation player places his factions corresponding identity card in his play area. The corporation's identity card represents his headquarters and also includes a unique special ability. The identity card defines the minimum deck size and maximum influence he can use for out-of-faction cards when deck building. The corporations play area houses three central servers, unlimited remote servers, his click tracker, score area and ICE. The corporation's central servers include the player's hand or headquarters, the draw deck, known as R&D and the discard pile, known as the archives. Remote servers are created by installing agenda or asset cards. Agendas are the only cards in the game worth agenda points and have an advancement requirement, that must be met before the corporation can score them. Assets can provide the corporation with resources, that help advance and score agendas. Operation cards represent single occurrences. Each operation is trashed to the archives after being resolved. Finally the corporation defends its servers against intrusions by installing ICE. Installed ICE is always dedicated to a particular server and is placed face down in front of that server horizontally. Each piece of ICE has a strength and a number of subroutines that a runner must circumvent before he can access servers. The corporation's installed cards have two play states: **Rezzed**, meaning that the card is face up and active, and **unrezzed** meaning that the card is face down and inactive. Only by paying the **rez** cost can the corporation, rez and installed card. While most corporation cards needs to be rezzed, before they can be utilized, agendas are never rezzed, instead they have an advancement cost. Only fully advancement agendas can be scored by the corporation.

Just as the corporations player's faction is represented by his identity card, the runner's faction is indicated by one of three identity cards, each of which has its own special ability. There are four types of runner cards, that are shuffled into the runners deck, also known as his stack. These card types are **hardware**, **resources**, **programs**, and **events**. Hardware, program and resource cards are not active until installed in the runners rig by paying the install costs listed on the card. Unlike the corporations cards, runner are always installed face up. Programs are digital tools at the runners disposal, primarily used as a means of intrusion. Hardware cards represent the array of physical tools at the runner's disposal and may include state-of-the-art consoles, chips or modifications. Resource cards represent a wide variety of connections, assets and skills that aid the runner. Lastly event card represent singular occurrences. Each event takes effect immediately when it is played  and is then trashed to the runners heap, when it is resolved.

## Gameplay - Turn 01 ##

In Android Netrunner the corporation and the runner each begin the game with a starting hand of five cards and five credits. Each player has a click tracker that he uses to track the number clicks he spends during his turn, The corporation can spend three clicks each turn, while the runner can spend four. The game begins with the coproration taking the first turn, which consists of three phases. The draw phase, the action phase, and the discard phase. The corporation player is using a Weyland Consortium deck and has a starting hand consisting of two assets, two pieces of ICE and ine one oepration. The corporation player begins the round, starting with the draw phase. He draws "Archer" from his R&D and adds it to his hand. The corporation player than begins his action phase of his turn and uses his first click to play "Hedge Fund", an operation card. He pays the play costs of five credits and resolves the ability, which gains him nine credits. After an operation card has been resolved, it is placed in the corporation archives. The corporation also gains one credit because of Weyland Consortium's identity ability. The corporation uses his second click to install his "Wall of Static" in front of his R&D, placing it horizontally to indicate that it is a piece of ICE. All corporations cards are installed face down to show that they are currently unrezzed, thus inactive until the corporation chooses to rez the card. The corporation player spends his third and final click to install "Pad Campaign" as a new remote server. With all of his clicks spent, the corporation player proceeds to the discard phase. Since the corporation player does not exceed his maximum hand size of five, he discards nothing and ends his turn.

The runner is playing "Gabriel Santiago", a criminal faction runner and has as starting hand of one program, one piece of hardware, two events, and one resource. The runner's turn is divided into two phases, the action phase and the discard phase. The runner tracks four clicks during his turn. He begins his action phase, by installing "Deperado" into his rig. This cost him one click and three credits, the install costs of the card. With his second click, decides to make a run. When making a run, the runner chooses any of the corporations servers to run against. In this case the runner chooses to make a run against the corporations R&D. When beginning a run, the runner approaches any ICE protecting the chosen server, starting with the outermost piece. The runner must pass each piece of ICE in order to approach the next piece protecting the server. If the corporation does not have enough credits or chooses not to rez the encountered ICE, the runner may pass to the next piece protecting the server until all pieces have been passed or until the run ends.

In this example decides to rez the "Wall of Static", that is protecting his R&D, paying three credits to do so. The "Wall of Static" is a piece of ICE with a **Barrier** subtype. Since the runner does not have a program in place that will allow him to break a barrier subtype, he is forced to suffer the subroutine effects and must end the run on the R&D. With his third click, the runner decides to make another run. This time on the corporation's headquarter, which represents the corporation's hand of cards. Since there is no ICE currently protecting the headquarters, the run is successful and the runner gains access. The runner also gains a credit from "Desperados" ability and another two credits from "Gabriels Santiago" ability. The runner draws one card from the corporations hand of cards and reveals "Hadrian's Wall". Some corporation cards have a trash cost. If the runner accessed a card with a trash cost, he may pay an equal amount of credits to trash it to the archives. Since "Hadrian's Wall" does not have a trash cost, the runner notes the existence of this piece of ICE and then returns it to the corporation's player hand. The runner then uses his fourth and final click to play his "Special Order" event, which costs one credit to play and allows the runner to search his stack for any icebreaker and add it to his hand. The runner chooses and reveals "Aurora", an icebreaker program, that allows the runner to break ICE with barrier subtype such as the corporations newly rezzed "Wall of Static". With all of his clicks spent, the runner then proceeds to the discard phase. Since the runner's hand does not exceed five cards, he does not have to discard.

## Gameplay - Turn 02 ##

At the beginnning of his turn the corporation player decides to res his previously installed "Pad Campaign". The corporation pays two credits, the rez costs of the card, and then gains one credit from the "Pad Campaign" ability. The corporation player will gain credit in the beginning of his turn as long as "Pad Campaign" remains in play. Next, the corporation player draws "Hostile Takeover" from R&D and spends his first click to install it as a new remote server. He then spends his second and third click plus two credits to advance hostile takeover in order to meet its advancement requirement. Once an agendas advancement requirement has been met, it can be scored at any time. The credits used to advance the agenda are considered spent and are returned to the token bank. When scored "Hostile Takeover" gives a bonus of seven credits, however "Hostile Takeover" also gives the corporation one bad publicity, which gives the runner one free credit at the beginning of each run. The runner may spend these credits during his run as if they were in his credit pool, but any unspent publicity credits return to the token bank at the end of the run. With all oh his clicks spent, the corporation player then proceeds to the discard phase. Since his hand does not exceed five cards, he does not have to discard.

The runner begins his action phase by spending his first click to make a run on the corporation's headquarters. Because of bad publicity, the runner gains one free credit for starting a run. Since there is no ICE protecting the headquarters, the runner accesses the corporation's hand. Because the run was successful, the runner gains one credit for using "Desperado" and two more credits because of "Gabriel Santiago"'s id ability. The runner accesses a "Melange Mining Corp." asset and using the free bad publicity credit, trashes "Melange Mining Corp." to the corporation company's archives. The runner spends his second click and one credit, the install cost of the card, to install his "Armitage Codebusting" resource. Once the resource is installed, twelve credits are placed on "Armitage Codebusting". The runner can now spend one click to gain two credits from this resources until of its twelve credits are depleted. The runner spends his third click and three credits to install his "Aurora" icebreaker. The runner spends his final click to make a run on R&D and because of bad publicity gains one additional credit to use during the run. The corporation's "Wall of Static", which is protecting his R&D has a strength of three, while the runner's newly installed "Aurora" only has a strength of one. An icebreaker can not break any subroutines on a piece of ICE with a higher strength. However "Aurora" can be strengthened by spending credits. The runner pays two credits to increase "Aurora" strength from one to four. The runner then pays two credits to break the "Wall of Static"'s "End the run" subroutine and gains access to R&D. Because the run is successful the runner gains one credit from "Desperado" ability. The runner accesses the top card from R&D and reveals a "Private Security Force" agenda card. Whenever the runner accesses an agenda it is stolen and immediately scored by the runner. The runner is then out of clicks, so his action phase is over. Since he is under the hand limit of five cards, the runner does not have to discard during the discard phase.

## Gameplay - Turn 03 ##

At the beginning of his the corporation player collects one free credit from his installed and rezzed "Pad Campaign" asset, then begins his draw phase by drawing a "Priority Requisition" agenda from his R&D. The corporation now begins his action phase and spends his first click to install "Priority Requisition" as a new remote server. This new agenda must be advanced before it can be scored, so the corporation player chooses to protect it by playing ICE, spending his second click to do so. He chooses to install "Archer", because it is a piece of ICE with a sentry subtype, which the runner has no programs to break. The corporation player then spends his final click to install "Hadrian's Wall" in front of his headquarters, in order to stop the runner from gaining free credits using "Gabriel Santiago"'s ability and to prevent the runner from accessing his hand in the future. The corporation player has now spent all of his clicks and proceeds to the discard phase. Since he has zero cards in his hand, the corporation player has nothing to discard.

The runner currently has one credit in his credit pool, so he begins his action phase by spending his first click to gain two credits from his "Armitage Codebusting" resource. Next he uses his second click to play "Infiltration", which exposes any card the runner wishes to see. He chooses to expose the corporation's newly installed remote server, the "Priority Requisition" agenda. The runner, seeing that "Priority Requisition" is a high value agenda, decides that the rewards outweigh the risks of running with an unrezzed piece of ICE. Once the exposed card has been viewed by the runner it is returned to the corporation in its original face down position. The runner decides to spend his third click to gain two more credits from his "Armitage Codebusting" resource, hoping that "Priority Requisition" is protected by a piece of ICE with a barrier subtype, which his "Aurora" program can break. He then spends his final click to make a run on the "Priority Requisition" server, gaining one free credit for bad publicity. The runner's gamble fails. The corporation rezzes "Archer", a sentry piece of ICE, which costs four credits and requires the corporation to forfeit an agenda. When the corporation player forfeits an agenda, he chooses any agenda in his score area and removes it from the game. That agenda no longer gives him points. The corporation player has only one agenda in his score area, the previously scored "Hostile Takeover" agenda, which he forfeits. Since "Archer" is a piece of ICE with the sentry subtype and since the runner does not have an icebreaker program that can break sentries, he is forces to suffer the effects of "Archer"'s subroutines. The first subroutine gives two credits to the corporation, the second subroutine allows the corporation to trash the runner's "Aurora" program. The third subroutine has no effect, because "Aurora" was the runner's only installed program and the fourth subroutine ends the run. Also since the runner was unable to use the free bad publicity credit it is once again returned to the token bank.

Play continues until one player scores seven agenda points or the game is decided by one of two other victory conditions. If the runner takes more damage than number of cards in his hand, he is flatlined and the corporation wins the game. Alternatively the corporation looses if his R&D is ever fully depleted of cards.

The network is omnipresent. The crux of modern modern human civilization and while visionary corporations seek to secure their most valuable data on the network, the elite hackers known as netrunners seek to steal it. Welcome to the future, welcome to Android Netrunner.

## Troubleshooting ##

## Do I have to shuffle, when moving a card from Archives to HQ when using "Archived Memories" ? ##

## How does "Datasucker" work ##

As far as I understand I install the card in my rig. I'm confused by the phrasing

> [...] until the end of the encounter.

But why not just say. Each ICE has a strength of `-1` ?

**A:** It does exactly what it says. If you do a run, each rezzed ICE you encounter has a strength modifier of `-1` for each counter until the end of the encounter.

## How do I use the Private Security Force ability? ##

Do I need to rez the card ? Do I need to advance the card ?

## What happens to a virus card like "Parasite" if the ICE is trashed ? ##

## Can I use multiple icebreaker together when breaking ICE ? ##

Can I combine the strength of multiple icebreaker. Can I use the strength of one icebreaker, and the abilities of another?

## When can I rez an upgrade, when the player makes a run ? ##

In the "Timing Structure of a Run" under point `2.3` it says

> Approached ice can be rezzed, Paid Abilities can be rezzed, Non-ice cards can be rezzed

As far as I understand this states that I can't rez an upgrade before I can rez an ICE. Which in case of "Akitaro Watanabe" is really unsatisfying, as I understand that the upgrade needs to be rezzed before the ICE, before I can make use "Akitaro Watanabe"'a ability to reduce ICE cost.

The example on page 19 does also involve this situation with "Akitaro Watanabe" and the upgrade is rezzed before the ICE.

## Deck Building ##

- "San San Grid"

- Don't be afraid to have only one copy of a card in your deck, especially if you play criminal and have "Special Order" event cards in your deck, which you can use to to search you stack for icebreaker.

- Searching your deck
	- "Special Order"
	- "Aggressive Negotation"

- Netrunner is very forgiving when it comes to deck building. Easier than in other games.

### Corporation ###

- "Coprporate Troubleshooter". Very good card. Only one copy in core set. You might want to buy another copy of the core set or even two (if you have too much money).
- Always have at least on "Snare"
- If you play against Shaper, diversify your ICE types, as Shaper's icebreakers gain strength per run
- "Archer" is a ridiculous good ICE

#### Weyland ####

- Use "Archer"

#### Haas-Bioroid ####

- Use "Archer"

### Runner ###

- Get "Coroder". It is good.
- "Diesel" is good. ANything that draws you cards gives you options. And in Netrunner it also gives your runner life!
- "Infiltration". Good for every deck, especially if you are a safer player
- "Crypsis". Versatile breaker. Expensive to play. If you are ahead, you stay a head card. Nay be good for Anarch decks because its a virus. On criminal decks its better to go for "Special Order"
- "Decoy" to avoid a tag. Influence 2.
- "Cyberfeeder" is good for every faction.

#### Criminal ####

- "Easy Mark" is good but not that great. Can be replaced with better cards
- "Forced Activation Orders". Forces behaviour upun corporation. Cheap and versatile.
- "Special Order". Very good card.
- "Bank Job". Solid money card.

#### Anarch ####

- Relies on combinations of cards. Very hard to play as it needs time to build. No money cards.
- You want as much memory as possible. Sou may want to use a few copies of Shaper's "Akamatsu Mem Chip"
- Anarch needs money. You may want to use three "Magnum Opus".
- You might me be interested in "Goardian Blade"
- "Ninja" is difficult to use.
- "Coroder". It is the best barrier icebreaker.
- "Cyberfeeder" is good.

#### Shaper ####

- "Rabbit Hole". Allows for deck thinning, as you weed out similar copies from your stack. Works best with three copies. Core set only comes with two.Good for criminal decks. Plays into Shaper strength.
- "Akamatsu Mem Chip"
- "Magnum Opus". Probably one of the most powerful money cards in the game. Runs never out of money.
- Use 3 "Diesel"
- "Modded" is a solid money card.
- "Goardian Blade" is awesome. It's the best code gate breaker.
- "Pipeline" sucks.
- "Battering Ram" is good but not great.
- "Peronal touch". At least one or two copies.

#### Criminal ####

- "Ninja" The best sentry breaker.

## Mulligan Strategies ##

- Runner
	- resource jump is very important
	- "Modded" is a good card (lowers install cost fpr program or hardware by 3)
	- "Magnum Opus" is good. Don't mulligan if you have it on starting hand
- Corporation
	- Mulligan if you have to many agendas (3+)
	- "Hostile Takeover" is great, as easily scorable and give money
	- No ICE, mull
	- 5 ICE, think about keeping them, probably works
