# rsync #

    rsync -rv
    rsync -arvz

r (recursive)
:   copies directories and sub directories

v (verbose)
:   prints on the screen what is being copied, increase verbosity by adding more `v`, like `-vv` or `-vvv`

a (archive)
:   symbolic links, devices, attributes, permissions, ownerships, etc. are preserved

z (compressed)
:   data will be compressed over the network

To copy the contents of `path` to `/volume/path/`

    $ rsync -r /path/ /volume/path/

To copy the folder `path` and its contents to `/volume/path` (it will create the folder: path):

    $ rsync -r /path /volume/path

Without the final slash, rsync will copy the directory in its entirety. With the trailing slash, it will copy the contents of the directory but wonâ€™t recreate the directory

Exclude files by adding patterns, for example you can exclude hidden files by adding

    --exclude=".*/"

rsync even has an built in option to exclude `cvs` or `svn` files, just add

    --cvs-exclude

## Useful examples ##

Copy files from `path` to `backup` deleting files that don't exist on the sending side, ignoring `.git`

	rsync -arvz --delete --exclude=.git /path /backup
	
Sync `.git` directory of the `~/Library/Scripts directory`

	rsync -arvz --cvs-exclude --exclude=.git --exclude=sync --exclude=.DS_Store . ~/Library/Scripts/

### rsync: command not found ###

I was trying to sync data to a Solaris machine but ran into this error:

	> rsync -arvz --stats someuser@remote-solaris-machine:path/to/project/ /path/to/remote/project
	bash: rsync: command not found
	rsync: connection unexpectedly closed (0 bytes received so far) [sender]
	rsync error: remote command not found (code 127) at io.c(454) [sender=2.6.9]
	
Rsync was installed on both machines but somehow the solaris machine wasn't able find rsync in the given path. I guess this is its trying to sync over ssh, and when by doing so doesn't include the `/usr/local/bin` directory.

Luckily you can pass the path of rsync as a parameter

	rsync -arvz --stats --rsync-path=/usr/local/bin/rsync someuser@remote-solaris-machine:path/to/project/ /path/to/remote/project
