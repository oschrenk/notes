# The Universe #

## Does the universe have an edge ? ##

There is no evidence that is has one. We do not know it. When people refer to the edge of the universe the the refer to the edge ob the **observable** universe.

## Did the Universe expand from a point? ##

No. The Big Bang wasm't an explosion in space. It was a process that involved all of space.

The Big Bang is mistakingly identified as an explosion that took place at some location, hurtling matter outward.

In reality, all of space was filled with energy right from the beginning.
