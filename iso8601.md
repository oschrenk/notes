*Strict ordering* ISO8601 defines the exact order at which the date should be represented, in a system that is called “big endian” (smallest last). This means that the biggest unit comes first, followed by the next, all the way down to the smallest. It also says that the biggest unit needed is year, so ISO8601 dates have to be ordered as `YYYY-MM-DD`, times have to be ordered to `HH:MM:SS`, followed by an optional second decimal

*Time zone support* It supports time zones, and it has a predefined way of doing so, like `+HH:MM` (or `+HHMM`). nherently ISO says you can optionally send as much data as you want to, and it still be a valid ISO string, so for example `YYYY` would be a valid ISO date, as would `YYYY-MM`, `YYYY-MM-DDTHH`. You can supply the time zone, or omit it, up to you. You can only omit going down though, so a date like MM-DD isn’t valid, because it is missing the year.

*The downsides*
- Unlimited decimals allowed for seconds,
- The `T` separator between the date and time can be pretty much anything,
- time zone can be omitted, or `Z`, 
- it can have a `:` to separate hours from minutes, or not.

*Intervals* An awesome but oft overlooked part of ISO8601 is intervals. There are four ways to express a time interval:

1. Start and end, such as `2007-03-01T13:00:00Z/2008-05-11T15:30:00Z`
2. Start and duration, such as `007-03-01T13:00:00Z/P1Y2M10DT2H30M`
3. Duration and end, such as `P1Y2M10DT2H30M/2008-05-11T15:30:00Z`
4. Duration only, such as `P1Y2M10DT2H30M`, with additional context information

Of these, the first three require two values separated by an interval designator which is usually a solidus or forward slash `/`. In certain applications, a double hyphen (`--`) can be used as a separator instead of a solidus (see Section 4.4.2 of the standard).
