# Game Mastering #

## Materials ##

- best solution is to select by consensus
- start out small and only buy if needed

## Game Preparation ##

As the very first game it is highly advised to modify an existing adventure instead of creating a new one. There will be plenty of time in other adventures, but first you will have to find your way as a game master, the group has to settle in, the players have to form a bond, the game mechanics are unclear. All people involved have a lot to learn. You will be disappointed if the first adventure isn't as fun as it could be or as you imagined it would be just because of some external factor.

- ask yourself  how much time you want to invest
- modify existing material, remembering
	- plan to complete game in one session
	- modify fluff or crunch, not both
	- re-skin to your liking
	- always ask yourself if you would have fun playing it

Plan to complete the first adventure in one sitting. Aim for four to five hours. An average game session contains up to two turn based events, sch as combat situations and two or three free-flow interactions. It should be comfortable for you and the players to meet up, settle down in your chairs, play the game and still have some time afterwards to talk about the session and say your goodbyes. If somebody feels rushed, it creates pressure on the game master. Every player (and the game master) should have a clear idea how the evening will develop.

### Setting expectations ###

Before the game

- make sure everybody knows where one can get food/drinks
- facilities (toilets)
- special needs (smoking room)

What are you interested in seeing?
What are you *not* interested in seeing?
 - violence against children, woman
 - slander against religion

Make sure players are comfortable with the system/setting/scope

- Rules management
	- clarify how rule questions will be answered
	- if there is a rule lawyer make him help you
	- if there is a question during the game that will long time to clarify or answer just mke it upon the spot and defer to the end of the game and involve the player for resolution of the question

Tell the players to

- accept failure and defeat (such as wounds or deaths). It#s part of the game and doesn't mean that the game master is winning. The game master is as much part of the game as the player and plays with the players, not against them.
- make sure that they will raise questions and tell you about problems with the game , other players or your style.

Talk to the players

### Know your players ###

- player experience
- different player types
- keep the quiet people near you

## Playing ##

### Running free-form scenes ###

- attention management
- empowerment, *say yes* or roll the dice
- 'Control' without shutting players down - "Yes, but..."
- Character vs. Player Attributes
- Approaches to 'problem' players
- Improvising
	1. *Steal* from other media to quickly come up with characters and situations
	2. *Take a break*. Excuse yourself to take a bathroom break, take fife minutes alone.
	3. *Be honest*. If you just don't know, be honest, own it and tell the players that you haven't planned for this, and ask them to follow a different path.
- NPCs
- Involve all players
	- make them roll dice tests together
	- try playing without a game master screen, it opens up the game

### Running turn-based scenes ###

- Time management
	- don't use a stop watch but be strict and consistent
- Player involvement
	- give enemy control to other players. It's frightening at first, but frees yourself up and gives other players something to do so that they feel involved
- turn management
	- make it visible who's turn it is, so that players can plan ahead

### Problem Players ###

???

### Player Feedback ###

- always observe your players
	- draw them back into action, subtle at first
- it's perfectly fine to ask if something is wrong
- ask for feedback at the end of the session
	- write the feedback down
