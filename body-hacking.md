Forms:
Wenn Sie daher Magnesium kaufen, dann erhalten Sie stets eine MagnesiumVERBINDUNG, also Magnesium, das mit einem anderen Stoff verbunden ist, wie z. B.

Magnesiumcitrat: Magnesium gebunden an Citrat, dem Salz der Zitronensäure
Magnesiumcarbonat: Magnesium gebunden an Carbonat, dem Salz der Kohlensäure
Magnesiumglycinat: Magnesium gebunden an die Aminosäure Glycin
Magnesiumorotat: Magnesium gebunden an Orotat, dem Salz der Orotsäure
Magnesiumsulfat: Magnesium gebunden an Sulfat, dem Salz der Schwefelsäure. Magnesiumsulfat wird auch als Epsom-Salz oder Bittersalz bezeichnet. (Nicht zu verwechseln mit Glaubersalz (= Natriumsulfat)).
Magnesiumoxid: Magnesium gebunden an Oxid, entsteht bei der Verbrennung des Magnesiums
Magnesiummalat: Magnesium gebunden an Malat, dem Salz der Äpfelsäure

Best forms:

*Magnesium Glycinate*. all-around most easily absorbale.is much less dependent on the acidity levels of the stomach.high bowel tolerance level.  Doesn't cause diarrhea. fuer besseren schlaf

*Magnesium taurate*. Good for cardiovascular issues. no laxative properties.

*Magnesium chloride*. aids kidney function and can boost a sluggish metabolism.

*Magnesium malate* -- Magnesium malate is a fantastic choice for people suffering from fatigue

## Vitamin B12
## Selenium
## Vitamin D
## Tryptophan

Tryptophan is an essential amino acid, meaning you need to get it from your diet because your body cannot produce it.

First, L-Tryptophan is converted into 5-hydroxy L-Tryptophan, or 5-HTP, and 5-HTP is then, in turn, converted into serotonin

*How should I take it*
Tips for making tryptophan work for you:

* Take it with a B-Complex vitamin
* Take it with Ester-C (vitamin C)
* Take all the above with fruit juice
* Make sure you take it on an empty stomach.

## Melatonin

Tryptophan > Serotonin > Melatonin

## Omega-3

### Claims:
#### Supports healthy cholesterol levels
> Supplementing with fish oil may support a healthy blood cholesterol profile already within a normal range. Adding 3-6 grams of fish oil a day can help promote healthy ratios of HDL to LDL, as well as healthy levels of triacylglycerol concentrations in the body when they are already in healthy range.
>
#### Boosts your mood
> Fish oil consumption helps support the levels of serotonin in the body, which is often termed the "feel-good" hormone. You'll typically reap the benefits of serotonin after eating a carbohydrate-heavy meal, which is what puts you in a relaxed and peaceful state. For this reason, individuals typically crave high-carbohydrate foods when they are stressed.

### Air
VOCs – Volatile organic compounds are emitted from hundreds of sources, like household cleaners and appliances, leading to side effects such as headaches and throat irritation.

PM2.5 – Otherwise known as dust, this particulate matter is 2.5 microns in size or smaller and is generated from cooking and burning things. Exposure to too much can lead to lung irritation and runny nose.

Carbon Monoxide – A colorless, odorless gas generated by some appliances and all automobiles that can prevent tissue oxygenation.

Carbon Dioxide – Generated from living and non-living things, this gas can decrease oxygenation and lead to fatigue.

Nitrogen Dioxide – Released by internal combustion engines, this gas can cause lung irritation and inflammation.

Ozone – This is created when nitrogen and VOCs interact in sunlight and can result in breathing problems.

Air Pressure – As measured by a barometer.

Temperature

Humidity – Too much humidity for excessive periods of time can increase the likelihood or mold or mildew accumulation.

### Amino Acids

Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins, which are essential to forming our muscles, tissues, organs, and glands. They also support human metabolism, protect the heart, and make it possible for our bodies to heal wounds and repair tissues. Amino acids are also essential for breaking down foods and removing waste from our bodies.

#### Essential Amino Acids

An essential amino acid that the body cannot synthesize on its own, so it must be obtained from the diet. Because each organism has its own physiology, the list of essential amino acids is different for humans than it is for other organisms.

histidine
isoleucine
leucine
lysine
methionine
phenylalanine
threonine
tryptophan
valine

#### Non-essential Amino Acids

### Serotonin

Serotonin is a neurotransmitter biochemically derived from tryptophan.

Serotonin appears to affect and/or regulate a number of body functions, including:
1. Digestion ???
2. Blood Clotting ???
3. Bone Density ???
4. Sexual Function ???
5. Mood ???

Most of you mistakenly believe antidepressants create more serotonin, therefore elevating mood.  This is a popular misunderstanding.  The fact is all SSRI antidepressants only trap serotonin between the neurons, creating a pooling effect which elevates mood. L-Tryptophan converts directly to serotonin.

## Symptoms

## serotonin deficiency syndrome

which may manifest as depression, anxiety, sleeplessness, aggression, nervousness, obsessive-compulsive behavior, and migraines ... many of the same symptoms that are being treated today in humans with SSRI's.
