[Guild Wars 2](https://www.guildwars2.com), a free to play MMO set in a fantasy world. It offers a single player game within the same world, instantiating levels if one chooses to enter and participate in single player events.

It offers very complex game mechanics, that are very hard to understand for genre novice.

## Play ##

### Daily Progress ###

Daily achievements are reset every day at midnight GMT. To view your progress go to your hero tab (`H`). On the left side, there will be an Achievements icon. Click it, then go to the Daily section. Daily achievements are tied to the account.

There are 4 types

- Daily Kill Variety (with 4 tiers)
- Daily Kills (with 3 tiers)
- Daily Gatherer (with 3 tiers)
- Daily Events (with 3 tiers)

Completing each tier awards you with 3% experience toward your next level. Completing all tiers of all daily achievements awards extra 3% experience, coins, one Mystic Coin and one Jug of Liquid Karma, meaning you have to

- kill 15 different types of enemies
- kill 60 enemies
- gather 20 raw materials
- complete 5 events

## Currency, Achievements, and Points ##

**Gems**. In-game currency. Must be bought with real money at an exchange rate of `€1.25/100`. Most purchases are just superficial, others are boosts (which can also be collected in game in normal ways). The only valid purchases I see at them moment are bank (`7.50€`, starting with 1, expandable up to 8, per account) and inventory slot expansions (`5.00€`, up to 8, per character) and maybe world transfers (up to `22.50€`).
**Arenanet points**. Just a measurement of achivements you've earned. There are (currently) no in game advantages.
