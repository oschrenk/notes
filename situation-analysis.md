# Situation Analysis | Template

1. Describe WHAT happened.  Within the /“slice of time” *describe, as if you were an observer*, who did or said what, focusing on behaviors. *Stick to the facts* and don’t tell how you felt or what you make of it/.
2. How did you INTERPRET what happened? Make on complete sentence for
	1. What do you think was happen- ing between you and the other person?
	2. What did the situation mean to you?
	3. What are your thoughts about it?
These interpretations will inform us about what the other person was doing, what you were doing, and what direction the exchange between you was taking.
3. Describe your BEHAVIORS during the situation
	* describe your behaviors during this exchange, that is, what you did? Please include observable descriptions about the tone of your voice, your body language, whether you made eye contact or not and whether you stayed or left the situation too quickly.
	* Looking at your behaviors in this step will help us understand how you arrived at the outcome or “endpoint” in the exchange you had with the other person. It will help us see why the situation turned out the way it did.
4. Describe how the event came out for You.
	* In this step you will describe how this exchange ended for you, in behavioral terms. This is called the *Actual Outcome (AO)*. The end of the situation is the same as the endpoint of the “/slice of time/” you chose. It is important to stay within the event you described in Step 1 and point out what you got out of it.
	* Please describe the *AO*using one complete sentence.
	* Would you say that you were satisfied with the outcome of this situation?
	* This step will help you learn to accurately recognize the outcome in an 	interpersonal exchange, see the impact you have had on the other person, and understand what behaviors you may need to change in order to reach your goals in your interactions with others. This is essential in helping you overcome your depression.
5. Describe how you Wanted the event to come out for You
	* How would you have liked the situation to end, particularly if you were not satisfied with the way it ended? This step asks you to propose an outcome that you would have wanted instead of the one you obtained in the situation; this is called the *Desired Outcome (DO).*Ask yourself: “How would I have wanted this exchange to end?”
	* This step asks you to pay attention to what you want and to formulate your answer in terms of a *behavior*that is under your control and that you can reach. Then you need to make one complete sentence describing one single *DO*.
	* Do you think your *DO*is attainable? Would the other person give you what you want? Is this *DO*under your control?
	* Is your *DO*realistic? Can you reach this goal with the skills you currently have?
6. Did you get what you wanted?
	 * This step gives us an opportunity to think about the consequences of your behaviors as observed in the *AO*, using this particular interpersonal situation as an example.
	* How do you understand the difference between the outcome that you did get, the *AO*, compared to the outcome that you would have wanted to get, the *DO*?
	* What are some explanations that you can think of to help you and the group understand why you don’t get what you want?
	* Are there other interpersonal situations in which you also see similar consequences of how you behave?
