## Moving to Amsterdam #

### Register with your municipality ###

If you intend to live in the Netherlands **for over 4 months**, you must register with your local municipality. **This is a mandatory procedure irrespective of your nationality**. **If you are moving within the Netherlands, you must inform your new municipality of your arrival**.

**The registration is done in person at your local city hall**. All family members that will be registered must be present. No registration fees apply. You have to bring the following documents: **valid passport** or identity card, legalised birth certificate, **and a proof of address**. If you are accompanied by your spouse, you must also bring your legalised marriage certificate. If you have any children with you in the Netherlands, their legalised birth certificates are also required.

Upon registration you are assigned a Citizen Service Number (BSN), which government agencies use in all correspondence with you.

The GBA Amsterdam is located at the Amsterdam Municipal Registry Office (Dienst Persoons- en Geoinformatie), Amstel 1, 1011 PN Amsterdam. **You can register as soon as you have a rental or purchase contract for accommodation**.

Registration takes place by appointment only. Please contact the Staff Immigration Office to schedule this appointment for you.

### Register with the immigration service ###

**As a citizen of a EU/EEA country or Switzerland, you do not need a visa or residence permit to stay in the Netherlands**. However, if you will be staying in the Netherlands for **longer than 3 months, it is advisable that you register with the Dutch Immigration and Naturalisation Service (IND)**. Upon registration you will be issued a registration statement (verklaring van inschrijving). Registration is free of charge.
You may have to show this IND proof of registration when you take out health insurance or, for example, if you apply for a mortgage.

Registration takes places at the IND Amsterdam, Stadhouderskade 85, 1073 AT Amsterdam.

The opening hours are Monday to Friday, 8:30-17:00 by appointment only. To arrange an appointment, call the service number 0900-1234561.

### Open a bank account ###

You need a Dutch bank account in order to receive your salary. Some grant-issuing bodies also require that you have a Dutch bank account. To be able to open a bank account, you need a Dutch BSN (Citizen Service Number).
Foreign citizens can open a bank account at any bank, upon presentation of their BSN and passport.

### Find a doctor ###

You will want to find a doctor and register as soon as possible when you arrive. Usually you must make an appointment first, which you do by calling the receptionist. Many doctors also have a telephone consultation hour (telefonisch spreekuur) for simple questions or repeat prescriptions. You can find doctors in your area using the website [www.docvadis.nl](http://www.docvadis.nl/search.html) (fill in your postcode in the second text box and click `zoek`).

### Register with a health care provider ###

You must take out health insurance within 4 months after you move to the Netherlands. If you fail to do so you may be fined 130% of the monthly premium over each month you have not been insured, with a maximum of 5 years. You can take out insurance with the Dutch health insurance company of your choice. A health insurance company cannot refuse to cover you for the standard insurance package, irrespective of your age or state of health. For every health insurance company, the standard insurance package is the same, but the contribution you have to pay may vary.

## Living in the Netherlands ##

### Going to the doctor ###

The doctor (huisarts) is usually the first port of call if you have health problems. If necessary, the doctor can then refer you to a specialist. When suffering from illnesses such as flu, a twisted ankle, abdominal pain, psychological problems, chronic illness or gynecological problems, contact the doctor first.
