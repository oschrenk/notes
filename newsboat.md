# Newsboat

```
brew install newsboat
```

On the very first start you are greeted with

```
$newsboat
Starting newsboat 2.10.1...
Loading configuration...done.
Opening cache...done.
Loading URLs from /Users/oliver/.newsboat/urls...done.
Error: no URLs configured. Please fill the file /Users/oliver/.newsboat/urls with RSS feed URLs or import an OPML file.
...
```

 you can import an OPML file by running "newsboat -i blogroll.opml".

I organized my feeds using Feedly but wanted a more local approach.

Export `opml` from Feedly  by visiting `https://feedly.com/i/opml` and push the button.
