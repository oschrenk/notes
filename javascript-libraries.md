# Javascript Libraries #

## Frameworks ##

[underscore.js](https://github.com/documentcloud/underscore/)

> Underscore is a utility-belt library for JavaScript that provides a lot of the functional programming support that you would expect in Prototype.js (or Ruby), but without extending any of the built-in JavaScript objects. It's the tie to go along with jQuery's tux.

[zepto.js](https://github.com/madrobby/zepto) 

> Zepto.js is a minimalist inlinable framework for mobile WebKit browsers, with a jQuery-like chaining syntax

## Templating ##

[mustache.js](https://github.com/janl/mustache.js)

> Minimal templating with {{mustaches}} in JavaScript

## MVC ##

[backbone.js](https://github.com/documentcloud/backbone)

> Backbone supplies structure to JavaScript-heavy applications by providing models key-value binding and custom events, collections with a rich API of enumerable functions, views with declarative event handling, and connects it all to your existing application over a RESTful JSON interface.

## Development ##

[QUnit](http://docs.jquery.com/Qunit)

> QUnit is a powerful, easy-to-use, JavaScript test suite. It's used by the jQuery project to test its code and plugins but is capable of testing any generic JavaScript code (and even capable of testing JavaScript code on the server-side).

## Graphs ##

[arbor.js]( http://arborjs.org)

> Arbor is a graph visualization library built with web workers and jQuery. Rather than trying to be an all-encompassing framework, arbor provides an efficient, force-directed layout algorithm plusabstractions for graph organization and screen refresh handling.

[data.js](http://substance.io/#michael/data-js)

> Data Manipulation and Graph Persistence for Node.js and the Browser.

## Graphics ##

[raphaël.js](https://github.com/DmitryBaranovskiy/raphael/)

> Raphaël is a small JavaScript library that should simplify your work with vector graphics on the web. (It) uses the SVG W3C Recommendation and VML as a base for creating graphics. This means every graphical object you create is also a DOM object, so you can attach JavaScript event handlers or modify them later. Raphaël’s goal is to provide an adapter that will make drawing vector art compatible cross-browser and easy.
