# Agile Development #

## Scrum ##

### Sprint Planning ###

- lock requirements during sprints
	- changes in mid-sprint jeopardize work investment
		- planning isn't free
		- work toward discarded/delayed feature isn't free
	- increases risk
		- other features may not get delivered
		- other features may get delivered with defects
- time boxing
	- easier planning
	- detects problems with features sooner
	- detects problems with development method sooner
	- known end date lends sense of focus and urgency
	- prevents feature creep
	- it's OK to let stories fail
- only the team estimates
	- only people actually doing the work should estimate effort
	- they have unique insight on obstacles
	- need additional hardware
	- estimates can reveal incorrect assumptions
- product owner availability
	- product owner has unique domain knowledge
	- needed for clarification during estimation
	- at first stories will be missing details too implement
	- it's a full time job

### Feedback ###

- demo every sprint
	- alternative is progress reports, which ca be misinterpreted
	- stakeholders need to see product early
		- they don't have time to read detailed specs
		- working software offers clearer picture
		- a clearer picture allows better panning
		- better planning means less wasted work
- make feedback easy
	- you need feedback from users too
	- but they're busy people
		- make it difficult, and issues will go unreported
		- make it easy, and their feedback will boost product quality
	- don't ignore what you get - read it in standup
		- good feedback boosts morale
		- bad feedback is a chance to improve

### Testing ###

- test at development time
	- separate test phase discovers bugs _after_ they're easy to fix
	- incurs dangerous technical debt
		- lowered velocity
		- compounding defects
		- rising support costs
	- if testers are at capacity, developers should help
		- if testing is a pain, developers will automate more of it
- shared definition of "done"
	- avoids miscommunication
	- keeps testing from slipping through cracks
