# ln #

The `ln` utility creates a new directory entry (linked file) which has the same modes as the original file.

Options

- `-s` Create a symbolic link.
- `-f` If the target file already exists, then unlink it so that the link may occur.
- `-v` Cause `ln` to be verbose, showing files as they are processed.
