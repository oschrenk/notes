## Sightseeing ##

I love the look of the (old) town. Just walk around. Take the small roads, avoid the Royal Mile. There are so many lovely shops there with so funny names. Oh the british - how they love puns.

- [Royal Botanical Garden](http://www.rbge.org.uk/). Lovely in the summer.
- [Edinburgh Castle](http://www.edinburghcastle.gov.uk/). Expensive. Full of tourists. There are far more interesting castles in Scotland (Sterling Castle) and more beautiful castles (Eilean Donan Castle). It works as background. 
- [National Monument](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Monument,_Edinburgh) Up on Calton Hill along with [Nelson Monument](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Monument,_Edinburgh). Go up the hill for the view and use the [Jacobs ladder](http://www.panoramicearth.com/4624/Edinburgh/Jacob's_Ladder) to get back into the town.
- [St Giles Cathedral](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Giles'_Cathedral) One (or only?) of the interesting points at the Royal mile.
- [Holyrood Park](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holyrood_Park) A must visit. Try to get up on [Arthur's Seat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur%27s_Seat,_Edinburgh) during sunset and enjoy!
- National Museum of Scotland

## Getting around ##

Just walk. Take your time and walk. It's the best way to get around. But if you must:

[Black Medicine](http://www.blackmed.co.uk/) Such a lovely place. Lots of wood and a dish washer that juggles.

[Balmoral Hotel](http://www.thebalmoralhotel.com/) For tea time. As to expect a little on the pricey side but the tea is good and the snacks (very expensive) are a must have - scones with clotted cream...

## Shops ##

There are so many shops that sell used stuff that the even offer a map for them. The girls will love it - I for one love hunting for used books.
