\\[ e^{i \pi} + 1 = 0 \\]

What does this mean. Let's start with \\(\pi\\). Everybody likes \\(\pi\\).

\\(\pi\\) is the ratio of circle diameters to its circumference

Fun fact. The height of an elephant (from foot to shoulder) \\(h = 2 \pi d\\) (\\(d\\) being the diameter of its foot).

Degrees are an arbitrary number, even aliens would use radians

\\[180° = pi\\]
\\[360° = 2pi\\]

\\(e^x\\) is its own differential

\\[(e^x)' = e^x\\]

It's also

\\[e^x = x^0/!0 + x^1/!1 + x^2/!2 + x^3/!3 + x^4/!4 + ...\\]

And you probably know it better as

\\[e = 2.7 1828 1828 45 90 45 ...\\]

But 

\\[sin x = x^1/!1 - x^3/!3 + x^5/!5 - x^7/!7 +  ... \\]
\\[cos x = x^0/!0 - x^2/!2 + x^4/!4 - x^6/!6 +  ... \\]

Now it get's freaky. Complex Numbers.

\\[i^2 = -1\\]

Complex numbers add another dimension and can therefore be written as distance to 0 point \\(4 +3i = 5(\cos \theta + i \sin \theta)\\)

\\[ e^{i \pi} + 1 = 0 \\]
