# Quicksilver #

## Usage ##

To relaunch Quicksilver

    Command-Control-Q

### Text input mode ###

press period `.`

## Useful triggers ##

### Access latest download ###

In order to enable “latest download” you need to turn on advanced features (in the main preferences tab) and proxy objects in `Quicksilver Preferences > Catalog > Quicksilver > Proxy Objects`

Something I was not aware of is that Quicksilver can access your latest download simply by you typing “latest download”! This is really handy and something I’ll be using a lot. I instantly made that into a trigger set to ⌘-⌥-^-L.
