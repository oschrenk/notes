# Graphs #

- _undirected_ graph
- _directed_ graph

For both forms there are variants allowing multiple edges, also called _multigraph_, permitting multiple edges between two nodes. A graph can also _weighted_ or unweighted. That means that each edge has been assigned a weight normally a number between zero and one.

A graph is a collection of nodes and edges.

A **node** or vertex is the fundamental unit of each graph. Nodes are (normally) connected with edges. These edges can have a direction or a weight. The _degree_ of a node describes how many edges are connected to a node. An _isolated node_ has no edges. A _leaf node_ is a node with just one edge. If the graph is directed, you distinguish between an _indegree_ for incoming edges and _outdegree_ for outgoing edges.
