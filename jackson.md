# Jackson Java JSON-processor #

[Jackson](http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome) is a multi-purpose Java library for processing JSON data format. Jackson aims to be the best possible combination of fast, correct, lightweight, and ergonomic for developers.

## Processing ##

Jackson supports three alternative ways of processing JSON:

1. Streaming API. Event based reading/writing of JSON similar to StAX.
2. Tree Model. Build in-memeory tree representation similar to XML DOM.
3. Data Binding. Converts JSON to and from POJOs based either on property accessor conventions or annotations.
