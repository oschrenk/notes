# Adobe Illusrtrator #

First off: I hate the interface. Most of the things are so counterintuitive.

## Close Path ##

**Close a Path Automatically**

To create a closed path with the Paintbrush tool (B) or the Pencil tool (N), start drawing, then click-and-hold the Option key (PC: Alt key). Continue drawing, and when youâ€™re ready to have the path closed for you, let go of the tool. Once the path has closed, then release the Option key (PC: Alt key).

**Close a path after you have drawn it**

Click on Direct Selection Tool  from the toolbar on the left, choose one anchor that haven't closed, then press Shift and click on another anchor. Right click, choose Average.

Check Both and click OK.
