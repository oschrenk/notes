# Clients

There is a nice twitter command line client out there

```
gem install t
```

You have to authorize the client as a Twitter App. Just follow the steps

```
t authorize
```

which includes creating an App, copying some secret API keys, and also, because twitter hates your privacy, giving them your phone number.
