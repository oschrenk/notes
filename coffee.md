## Grinding


I have to correct one of my posts. I have written:
"The Handground works with 125microns per step. The regular espresso range start at 400 microns and ends at 800 microns. This means that 2 or maybe 3 of the grindings settings for the handground are espresso settings."
The burr cone is moving by 125microns with each step. In fact this is not the same as saying that the grind size is chaning by 125microns because we are looking at conical burrs, not flat ones. In fact the grind size would change by 125*f microns, where f is:
f = sqrt[1/(1+(2H/(D_2-D_1))^2)]
H = height of the burr cone
D_2 = lower diameter of the burr cone
D_1 = upper diameter of the burr cone
Are the exact measurements of the burr cone used in the handground availabe somewhere? I would love to calculate the correct grind levels and compare them to the following general list:
- Turkish (approx. 100 microns)
- Mokka (approx. 200 microns)
- Espresso (approx. 300 microns)
- Paper Filter (approx. 500 microns)
- VacPot (approx. 600 microns)
- Metal Filter (approx. 700 microns)
- French Press (approx. 800 microns)
- Perculator (approx. 900 microns)
