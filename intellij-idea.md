# IntelliJ IDEA #

While I thought that Eclipse has some weird default settings, IntelliJ really takes the cake. The out-of-box experience is so bad that I disregarded the IDE for several years, trying it every other year. Which is a shame, as it is quite a good piece of software but the defaults especially the keyboard shortcuts are just awful.

- Disallow placement of caret after end of line. `IDE Settings > Editor > Virtual Space > Allow placement of caret after end of line`
- Allow selection of parts of a camel cased word via keyboard `IDE Settings > Editor > Smart Keys > Use "CamelHumps" words`
- Disallow selection of parts of a camel cased word when clicking on it `IDE Settings > Editor > Mouse > Honor "CamelHumps" word settings when selecting using double click`
- Show line numbers. `IDE Settings > Editor > Appearance > Show line numbers`
- Show method separators. `IDE Settings > Editor > Appearance > Show method separators`
- Show tabs in single row. `Editor > Editor Tabs > Show tabs in single row`
- Enable Zooming (I like it better than IntelliJ IDEA 13 presentation mode)`IDE Settings > Editor > Mouse > Change font size (Zoom) with Command + Mouse Wheel`
