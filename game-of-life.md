# Conway's Game of Life #

The rules for the Game of Life (GoL) can be stated in a few lines:

1. The world is an _infinite_ rectangular array of cells, each of which can be in one of two states: alive or dead; and the neighborhood of each cell is a `9×9` grid centered on the cell.
2. The state of the world advances in discrete synchronous time steps according to the following two rules:
3. Cells which are alive remain alive if and only if they have between 2 and 3 neighbors; otherwise they die.
4. Cells which are dead become alive if they have exactly 3 neighbors; or else they stay dead.
