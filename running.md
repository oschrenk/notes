# Running/Jogging

## Breathing

- breating in through nose doesn\t deliver enough oxygen to the muscles
- breathe in through mouth and nose
- breath from diaphragm, not from the chest, that is too shallow
- take deep breathes
- exhale through the mouth
- exhale fully to remove carbon dioxide
- try to take three footstrikes for every inhale, two footstrikes for every exhale

I'm not sure how it comes into play but fat is burned and mostly leaves the body by exhaling in the form of CO_2:

[When somebody loses weight, where does the fat go](http://www.bmj.com/content/349/bmj.g7257)

>> Excess carbohydrate or protein in the diet is converted to triglyceride and stored in the lipid droplets of adipocytes. Excess dietary fat needs no conversion other than lipolysis and re-esterification. People who wish to lose weight while maintaining their fat-free mass are, biochemically speaking, attempting to metabolise the triglycerides stored in their adipocytes.

The complete oxidation of a single triglyceride molecule involves many enzymes and biochemical steps, but the entire process can be summarised as:

```mathtex
C_{55}H_{104}O_6 + 78O_2 → 55CO_2 + 52H_2O+energy
```

At rest, an average 70 kg person consuming a mixed diet (respiratory quotient 0.8) exhales about200 ml of CO_2 in 12 breaths per minute.4 Each of those breaths therefore excretes 33 mg of CO_2, of which 8.9 mg is carbon. In a day spent asleep, at rest, and performing light activities that double the resting metabolic rate, each for 8 hours, this person exhales 0.74 kg of CO_2 so that **203g** of carbon are lost from the body.

For comparison, 500 g of sucrose (`C_{12}H_{22}O_{11}`) provides 8400 kJ (2000 kcal) and contains 210g of carbon. Replacing one hour of rest with exercise that raises the metabolic rate to seven times that of resting by, for example, jogging, removes an additional 39 g of carbon from the body, raising the total by about 20% to 240 g. For comparison, a single 100 g muffin represents about 20% of an average person’s total daily energy requirement. Physical activity as a weight loss strategy is, therefore, easily foiled by relatively small quantities of excess food.
