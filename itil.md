# Information Technology Infrastructure Library #

The [Information Technology Infrastructure Library](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Technology_Infrastructure_Library) (ITIL), is a set of practices for IT service management (ITSM) that focuses on aligning IT services with the needs of business.

## Incident management ##

**The goal of incident management is to restore a normal service operation as quickly as possible** and to minimize the impact on business operations. 'Normal service operation' is defined here as service operation within service-level agreement (SLA).

## Problem management ##

**Problem management aims to resolve the root causes of incidents** and thus to minimise the adverse impact of incidents and problems on business that are caused by errors within the IT infrastructure, and to prevent recurrence of incidents related to these errors.
