## Online Services ##

[Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/home/) is the best known online service that lets your community help you with the internalization of the product. My first impression wasn't so good though. I expected to just visit a project, translate some string and send them back to the project for review, but no! Now I'm awaiting the OK to join a team.

The way I see it, I should be able to just go ahead and translate everything I want. When translating a certain String the service will offer autocompletion for the String as other people have also translated it. The reviewer would then see a match rate sorted list of translations when reviewing the incoming translations.
