There are a few that you might be able to get some ideas from, but as with anything it's best to consult a lawyer familiar with your business and area of operations. Easier said than done when starting out, I know.
https://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/projects/contract-killer/ is an open source contract that's fairly popular and makes its rounds every couple years.
Obie Fernandez sold a Statement of Work (SOW) and Master Service Agreement (MSA) pair that was initially put together by his lawyer. http://blog.obiefernandez.com/content/msa-master-services-agreement-statement-of-work.html
There's Docray (no experience with them) http://www.docracy.com/
I like pinboard for searching a bit better than google, at least someone liked something enough to bookmark it (even if it was just to read it later) https://pinboard.in/t:contracts/t:legal
As far as language, the Contract Killer version is written in pretty understandable plain english. Obie's MSA/SOW bundle is lots of legalese.
Good luck!
